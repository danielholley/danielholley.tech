Main repository for the site https://www.danielholley.tech

I am designing my website to showcase my knowledge about web design and related fields and making it opensource so it can be evaluated as well as contributed to. I will also be releasing a lot of my apps for iOS/Android/Windows Phone so people can see how they are built. As I come up with projects I will add them to my site, as well as here on GitHub.
